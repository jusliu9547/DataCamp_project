Find the clutch performers\n<p>In many traditional track meets, after the first three throws the leaders in the field are whittled down to the top eight (sometimes more, sometimes less) athletes. Like the meet overall, this is solely based on their best throw of those first three. </p>\n<p>We give the choice to the managers. Of the three athletes who start each event, the manager chooses the two who will continue on for the last three throws. The manager will need to know which players tend to come alive – or at least maintain their form – in the late stages of a match. They also need to know if a player’s first three throws are consistent with their playing history. Otherwise, they could make a poor decision about who stays in based only on the sample unfolding in front of them.</p>\n<p>For now, let’s examine just our top-line stat – total distance covered – for
